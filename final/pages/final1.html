                <h2>What Is Responsive Web Design?</h2>
                <p>
                   <b>Responsive web design</b> refers to progressively enhancing a web page for different viewing 
                    contexts (including smartphones and tablets) through the use of coding techniques including 
                    fluid layouts, flexible images, and media queries.<sup>1</sup> <!--p280 Basics of Web Design-->
                    This is accomplished with the following techniques:
                </p>
                <ol class="noUnderline"> <!--ordered list of 5 or more items-->
                    <li><a href="#flexibleMeasurements">Flexible Measurements</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#flexibleImages">Flexible Images</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#mediaQueries">Media Queries</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#redesign">Redesign for Screen Sizes</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#metaViewportTag">Use of Meta Viewport Tag</a></li>
                </ol>
                <h3 id="flexibleMeasurements">Flexible Measurements</h3>
                <p>
                    Web designers use measurements that adjust to the screen size available such as % for container 
                    widths and ems for font sizes or padding rather than a fixed measurement such as a pixel (px). 
                    An em is a relative unit of measurement based on the default font size of the web browser. 
                    1em would be the same size as the default size. Decimals such as .5em can be used to declare 
                    half the size of the default font.
                </p>
                <h3 id="flexibleImages">Flexible Images</h3>
                <p>
                    Images become flexible when their height and width attributes are removed so that they no longer 
                    have fixed size constraints.  A max-width of 100% rule is added in CSS which allows the image 
                    to flex as the page is scaled smaller.
                </p>
                <h3 id="mediaQueries">Media Queries</h3>
                <p>
                    Media queries set breakpoints for different screen sizes based on typical measurements such as a 
                    full screen for monitors, tablet sizes and then mobile size screens. Typical widths used for those 
                    breakpoints are at 64em for tablets and 37.5em for smartphones.
                </p>
                <h3 id="redesign">Redesign for Screen Sizes</h3> <!--Added this so I could have 5 items in my list-->
                <p>
                    Because the screen real-estate is so dramatically different, a benefit of using media queries is 
                    the ability to move content and other elements around to optimize the user experience based on 
                    what size viewport they are using. Full size screens tend to have content spread out more 
                    horizontally where smaller devices such as smartphones tend to be narrow, so designers will 
                    modify the scheme vertically.
                </p>
                <h3 id="metaViewportTag">Meta Viewport Tag</h3>
                <p>
                    The meta viewport tag &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt; 
                    is placed in the Head section of an HTML file and tells the browser to scale the page to the size 
                    of the viewport.  This ensures that no matter what size screen is being used, the page will look 
                    as it was intended.

                <h2>Common Media Types</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Media</b> are the communication outlets or tools used to store and deliver information or data.
                    <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)" target="_blank">2</a></sup>  
                    The World Wide Web itself is a medium used to share information where files written in 
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">hypertext markup 
                    language</a> (HTML) can be viewed with a software application called a web browser. In its most basic 
                    form, a web page will contain text which may also include links to other web pages. Cascading style sheets 
                    (CSS) and JavaScript are two other languages that, combined with HTML, make websites informative, 
                    attractive, and interactive.</p>
                <p>   
                    In addition to basic text, there are many types of media incorporated into web sites in order to enhance 
                    the user experience or communicate in a different way.  The most common of those we will discuss are:
                </p>
                <ul> <!-- unordered list of 5 or more items-->
                    <li>Images</li>
                    <li>Video</li>
                    <li>Audio</li>
                    <li>Portable Document Format (PDF)</li>
                    <li>File Downloads</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Flex and Respond</h3>
                <p>Change the width of your browser to see this image <i>flex</i> and the page content <i>respond</i> fluidly!</p>
